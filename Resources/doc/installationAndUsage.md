Scribite 6.0.0 Installation and Usage
=====================================

Scribite is installed the same as any Zikula module from the Extensions page.

Scribite works as a *hook-based* module __only__. This means in order to utilize its functions, you must hook
Scribite (the provider) to the module you wish to use the editors in (the subscriber). To hook them together, go to the
subscriber module's admin page and click the hooks link in the admin bar. You will see a drag and drop interface
allowing you to drag Scribite to your intended subscriber. After this, go to your subscriber's 'new item' page and the
textarea should have a new WYSIWYG editor!


Scribite Settings
-----------------

Choose the editor you wish to use for all modules in the module settings.


Editor List
-----------

This is a list of each editor present in the system. Each editor has its own settings. These are configured through the
action icon within this list. Items like width and toolbar choices are set here.


Module and textarea overrides
-----------------------------

For advanced users, it is possible to exert fine-grained control on exactly how you would like your editors to work. You
can do this through module and textarea overrides.

If you would like a specific module to use an editor different from the default, you can set this as a module override
by selecting the module and choosing an editor.

If you would like to assign specific editor parameters to a textarea for use in the template or you would like to
disable one of the textareas (but not all of them) on a page, you can do so in the textarea override section. These
parameters will be applied to the editor's config object as appropriate. Not every editor supports custom configuration
nor does the editor version necessarily implement the custom config, if available. The parameters and their values must
make sense to the editor or they could cause unusual behavior in the editor. Values here will override default values in
`editorheader.html.twig.`

In order to make param overrides work, a functional knowledge of the editor and its underlying configuration mechanism
will be required.


Image upload with KCFinder
--------------------------
CKEditor and TinyMCE editors can be integrated with KCFinder web file manager (http://kcfinder.sunhater.com/). This
provides to them the ability to upload images from the editor interface (via image buttons). For now, Scribite
integration is automated for CKEditor only.

Steps to install:
1. Download KCFinder Zikula plugin from here: https://github.com/nmpetkov/Kcfinder-zk.
2. Install and configure plugin (see plugin documentation).
3. In Scribite, Editor List, CKEditor, Configure, in field "Path to filemanager" enter valid path to KCFinder, something
   like `editors/ckeditor/ckeditor/plugins/kcfinder`.
4. Delete the directory `web/editors/ckeditor` (it will rebuild itself).

Now Scribite will automatically integrate KCFinder interface into CKEditor, and enable upload and browse functionalities
for images and other permitted files.
