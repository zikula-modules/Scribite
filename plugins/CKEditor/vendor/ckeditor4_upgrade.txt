Upgrade instructions for CKEditor 4 package
============================================

1. Download from vendor website using builder:
http://ckeditor.com/builder
- choose FULL preset.
- at that point without selecting any optional plugins (right panel);
- select all available languages;
This is base package, and in next step will add more plugins and skins. It is important for CKEditor to work normally to use ckeditor.js from this download.
2. Download with builder again, with all optional plugins selected and optional skin (kama) selected.
- from this download copy optional plugins to first downloaded package, also optional skin. Attention for respective directories.
- check plugins directory for missing optional plugins, and if some are missing - download manually them and copy in plugins directory.
3. Add custconfig.js from previous version to main package directory for updated version.
